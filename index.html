		<ol>
			<li><h4>Useful is forever</h4></li>
			<p>
				Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you dont.
			</p>
			<li><h4>Great service is everything</h4></li>
			<p>
				Were famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. <a href="http://smiley.37signals.com/">See how our customers rate our service.</a>
			</p>
			<li><h4>Clarity is King</h4></li>
			<p>
				Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
			</p>
			<li><h4>Our customers are our investors</h4></li>
			<p>
				Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
			</p>
		</ol>
		<ol start ="5">
			<li><h4>The basics are beautiful</h4></li>
			<p>
				Well never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customers time, money, and trust.
			</p>
			<li><h4>No hidden fees or secret prices</h4></li>
			<p>
				We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
			</p>
			<li><h4>Software should be easy</h4></li>
			<p>
				Our products are intuitive. Youll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We dont sell you training because you dont need it.
			</p>
			<li><h4>Long-term contracts are obscene</h4></li>
			<p>
				No one likes being locked into something they dont want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
